# Adaptable text Representations Compressor

This repository contains the code to reproduce most of the experiments of the paper \[BLABLA](bla). You can pretrain and fine-tune your own ARC-Encoder. Using the pretrained checkpoints we released, you can easily fine-tune an ARC-Encoder on specific datasets. 


## üì• Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone this repository
```sh
git clone ...
```
Once cloned set import paths at `embed_llm/__init__.py`.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install all required dependencies:
We recommend using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage the environment.
It's about 10x faster than `pip` and has a bunch of other benefits too.
Once you've installed `uv`, no explicit package installation is required:
just prefix every command with `uv run` (e.g. train using `uv run torchrun ...`).
This will automatically install the necessary dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

#### Installing without `uv`

If you prefer working with `pip`, and handling the install manually, you will need at least Python 3.10. 
We still advise using a virtual environment,
which can be created using [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install#quickstart-install-instructions)
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).
Then, run:

```sh
cd moshi-finetune
pip install -e .
```




### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Load backbone models

In the directory (<MODEL_PATH>) where you want to store the different backbone models for your ARC-Encoder and decoder, for Llama models you need to register on this website [Llama downloads](https://www.llama.com/llama-downloads/) and get the download url:
```
# For Mistral 7B
wget   https://models.mistralcdn.com/mistral-7b-v0-1/mistral-7B-v0.1.tar -P <MODEL_PATH>/mistral_7B

# For Llama3.2 3B
wget   url -P <MODEL_PATH>/Llama3.2-3B

# For Llama3.1 8B
wget   url -P <MODEL_PATH>/Llama3.1-8B

# For Llama2 7B Chat

```


## üìö Prepare datasets

For the fine-tuning dataset, please directly load our HuggingFace dataset at [BLABLA](blabla). Use the `load_datasets.ipynb` notebook to load the evaluation datasets. Then, you should run `retrieval/embeddings.py` (on GPUs if possible) to create embeddings of the Wikipedia text chunks and `retrieval/passage_retrieval.py` (you can stay on CPUs) to retrieve passages from Wikipedia for Natural Question and TRIVIAQA as done in the paper.
